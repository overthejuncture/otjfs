migration files are just classes with up() and down().

inside there is a static function of a Schema class.
Function defines operation (Create table, change column, etc).
Operation should have callback parameter. It should receive a $blueprint.
$blueprint is a class, that contains instructions of operation. Like text(),
which means that a column with a varchar type should be created.
